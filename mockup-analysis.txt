CHATCONTROLBOX MOCKUP ANALYSIS
==============================

DESKTOP MOCKUP (ChatControlBox-mockup.png):
- Single row layout with all elements inline
- Left side: Menu (hamburger), Plus, Models (blue pill with sparkle icon), Synthesizer (sound bars), Settings (gear), Save (floppy), Presets (text)
- Right side: Input field with placeholder "Type your message...", paperclip, connectors, mic icons inside, Send button (blue circle with arrow)
- Cyan/teal glow border effect
- Dark background

MOBILE MOCKUP (ChatControlBox-mobile-mockup.png):
- TWO-ROW layout:
  - Row 1: Menu, Plus, "0 Models" (blue pill), AI head icon (cyan), Gear, Save (floppy), Presets (cream pill)
  - Row 2: Full-width input with paperclip, connectors icon, placeholder text, mic icon
- Placeholder when disabled: "Select at least one AI model to send a message"
- Light gray/cream colored input field
- Rounded container with subtle border

KEY DIFFERENCES FROM CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Desktop should be SINGLE row, not two rows
2. Mobile should be TWO rows (toolbar + input)
3. Placeholder text should change based on model selection state
4. Icons should be inside the input field on mobile
5. Send button visible on desktop, hidden on mobile
6. Cyan/teal accent color scheme
