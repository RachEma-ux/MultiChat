CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS
======================

SCREENSHOT OBSERVATION:
- The ChatControlBox is at the BOTTOM of the screen
- It shows a two-row layout:
  - Row 1: Menu, Plus, "0 Models" pill, Bot icon, Settings, Save, Presets
  - Row 2: Input field with paperclip, mic, connectors, send button
- The component appears mostly correct but very small/compressed

ISSUES IDENTIFIED FROM SCREENSHOT:
1. Component is barely visible - very thin/compressed
2. Layout appears correct (2 rows) but elements are tiny
3. Colors are muted - not matching the cyan/teal mockup

MOCKUP COMPARISON:
Desktop mockup: Single row with all elements inline
Mobile mockup: Two rows (toolbar + input)

CURRENT CODE STRUCTURE (lines 565-940):
- Main container: bg-zinc-800 rounded-2xl border border-zinc-700/50 mx-2 mb-2
- Control row: flex items-center gap-1.5 md:justify-center justify-between flex-wrap
- Input row: flex items-center gap-2

KEY PROBLEMS TO FIX:
1. Desktop should be SINGLE row, not two rows
2. Need to add cyan/teal accent colors matching mockup
3. Textarea placeholder should change based on model selection
4. Need proper sizing and spacing
5. Need glow effect on container border

DESIGN TOKENS FROM MOCKUP:
- Primary accent: Cyan/Teal (#00D4FF or similar)
- Background: Dark navy (#1a1a2e or similar)
- Input background: Dark gray with subtle border
- Models pill: Blue (#3b82f6)
- Presets pill: Cream/light gray
- Container: Rounded with cyan glow border
